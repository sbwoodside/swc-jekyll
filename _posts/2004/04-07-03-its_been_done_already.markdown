title: it's been done already

picturephoning <a href="http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/004397.htm">writes about </a>Fujitsu's "new" technique for embedding a barcode into an otherwise normal looking image. It has, however, already been done. At least one example, <a href="http://www.parc.com/research/asd/projects/dataglyphs/">Dataglyph </a>, was developed at least as early as 1995 (see <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/boney96digital.html">citeseer </a>) and maybe earlier, I haven't tracked it all the way down yet. These techniques all amount to essentially the same thing, which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography </a>. The main disadvantage of this technique for the kind of applications that Fujitsu, PARC, and others imagine is a simple matter of <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">UE, user experience </a>. If the users can't see the message, how do they know it's there?
