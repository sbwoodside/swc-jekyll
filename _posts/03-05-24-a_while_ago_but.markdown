<p>The COOK report <a href="http://wireless.oldcolo.com/biology/progress2000/cookjul.txt">interviewed David Hughes about Wi-Fi </a>. </p><blockquote><p>COOK Report: So is it safe to assume that you can buy an actual 11 megabit per second radio for under $1,000? </p><p>Hughes: Yes. </p><p>COOK Report: Way under a thousand? </p><p>Hughes: Yes. But there is a difference between buying a Base Station radio - that can handle hundreds of client radios, and a one IP/MAC address radio - for the client end. Both prices have come down rather dramatically, with client radios now below the magic 'consumer'$500 price point. Which happens to be what I had to pay for a 1200 baud Hayes Micromodem back 15 years ago. </p></blockquote>
