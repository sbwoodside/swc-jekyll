title: my thresholding is getting pretty good 
---


My thresholding algorithm for semacode is getting pretty good I think. Check out these results on the classic "Barbara" computer graphics test image.<img src="/weblog/images/2004/barbara.jpg" alt="barbara" />

Next up we have my threshold of the image (adaptive, with an algorithm based on Chow and Kaneko, but the bimodal detector isn't as good as theirs)<img src="/weblog/images/2004/barbara.png" alt="barbara" />

Finally, by comparison, a threshold of the image by the person <a href="http://students.washington.edu/%7Exdsong/index_files/algorithms/Active%20surface%20based%20adaptive%20thresholding.htm">at this page </a>. Mine is better in some places (like the fabric grain and the hand) but not as good in others (like the face).<img src="/weblog/images/2004/barbara.gif" alt="barbara" />

(If you go there you can also see what you get with global threshold, which isn't as good.)
