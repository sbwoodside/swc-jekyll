title: server broken again... 
---


So my sysadmin has broken his server again. No, this time it's just mod_perl that's broken. I think he uses debian package distupgrade without actually paying attention. Not a good idea. So none of my sites work. I have forwarded this site to my own computer for the duration of the outage.
