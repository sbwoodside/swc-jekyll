title: Windows is stupid 
---


So I kinda sorta have a computer that's finally capable of running WinCrap32 on my powerbook, and what do you know I need to install service packs. Galore. It's so precise that it tells me exactly how many and how big they will be:<blockquote>Total: 19 = 10.600000000000001 MB </blockquote>

What the hell is that???
