title: Amazing comment spam
---
<p>I got some really awesome comment spam recently. Here's an example, from my post on <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/weblog/2011/2/13/cs_rap_geeksta_rap_nerdcore/">Nerdcore music</a> (I deleted the comment because it contained a spam link):</p><blockquote><p>LOL. I think you may have missed your calling. What you need to do now is get some oversized pants and some dark shades. Add a little bling, and they go on tour. You'll pull geeks out of the woodwork. Heck, I bet you could fill a decent sized coffee shop. On second thought, maybe you should stick to your day job.</p></blockquote><p>If this was written by a human, they put some actual thought and energy into it. If it was written by a chatterbot, I'm seriously impressed. Either way, great work, whoever you are!</p>
