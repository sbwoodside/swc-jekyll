I've been watching a lot of torrents lately and frankly, a lot of it has been crap. Like this "Around the world in 80 treasures" show where the host is just insufferable (deleted). Also I've been watching these SNL best of shows and they're pretty good. This one is the best so far. 

<a href="http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3348685">Go and grab the torrent from The Pirate Bay </a>or view the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0382275/">IMDB page </a>. Until next week, enjoy your <strong>A bit of torrent </strong>!
