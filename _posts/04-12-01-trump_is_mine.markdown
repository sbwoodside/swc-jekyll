title: tru.mp is mine 
---


So I'm hanging out on the <a href="http://www.mobitopia.com/">#mobitopia channel </a>and aeden was on there talking about his new site for .mp : <a href="http://get.mp/">Get.MP </a>where you can register on this new TLD. Well, what do you know, there's still plenty of 3-letter domains left, so I went with the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us </a>trent and got myself <a href="http://tru.mp">tru.mp </a>. I don't really have any plan to use it but I figure I can sell it off at a profit someday.
