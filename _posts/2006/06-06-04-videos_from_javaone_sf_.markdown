What have we here? You guessed, some cheesy grainy videos from San Francisco. Let's start with the big one. It's Paul. Yup. And he's not aware he's being filmed. Hmm. Then, he realizes he's being filmed, and so he insults me.<div><sax:include xmlns:sax="http://simonwoodside.com/simon-axkit"><sax:url>/shared/saxinc/movie.xml </sax:url><sax:query>href=/weblog/media/2006/20060519-sea-lions2.3gp </sax:query></sax:include></div>

Next I give you ... what was that?<div><sax:include xmlns:sax="http://simonwoodside.com/simon-axkit"><sax:url>/shared/saxinc/movie.xml </sax:url><sax:query>href=/weblog/media/2006/20060519-sea-lions3.3gp </sax:query></sax:include></div>

Oh, it was a sea lion. Yawn.
