<p>Hello world! I'm typing this in using the tiny numerical keypad on my 3650 and i have to say it's pretty damn awkward! I am using putty, an ssh client for symbian. </p><p>Later: That's right, I logged into my server using ssh from a cell phone. I had to type all the commands in using the numerical keypad. I'm not quite sure that it will ever be of any use though. </p>
