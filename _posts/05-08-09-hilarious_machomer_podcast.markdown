<p><a href="http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/">Ewan Spence </a>has an awesome podcast: <a href="http://edinburghfringe.thepodcastnetwork.com/2005/08/09/the-edinburgh-fringe-2005-show-003/">The Edinburgh Fringe 2005 Show with MacHomer </a>. MacHomer is this crazy guy who does impersonation of all the Simpsons characters talking about a production of MacBeth. It's hilarious. Ewan does a really good interview. </p><p>Actually this is the first podcast I've listened to that's good I think... the other ones I've listened always seem pompous and self-important. </p><p>And the MacHomer guy is Canadian :-) </p><p>OK, as a public service I'll see if I can find any online sources for the actual MacHomer show... </p><ul><li><a href="http://lcctheatre.hawaii.edu/machomer.html">Want to hear some of MacHomer's interesting voices? </a></li><li>damn! that's all I can find. someone bootleg this sucker! </li></ul>
