The main problem with RFID is remote hacking. You can just walk by someone, or aim an antenna at them, and pick up their RFIDs. So in <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/07/13/japan_schoolkids_to_be_tagged_with_rfid_chips.html">this example </a>a malicious user can find out a kid's unique ID, and potentially their full identity, just by walking by the kid.
