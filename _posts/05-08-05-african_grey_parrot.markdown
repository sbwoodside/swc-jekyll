<p><a href="/weblog/media/20050706-parrot-grooming.3gp%20">Look at this magnificient parrot - wonderful plumage! </a></p><p>I captured it on digital film at the local bird sanctuary. It seems to have a clipped tail. I assume that it sustained some injury but what do I know. Anyway, this particular parrot gets a lot more interesting around dusk when it likes to talk. It knows how to say Hello and lots of interesting whistles. </p><p>I tried to edit the video with Quicktime Pro but the transcoding really ruined the quality. Next time I'll try editing it on the phone which might give a better quality if it avoids <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcode">transcoding </a>. Also I discovered that the 3GPP video standard produces videos with an 11:9 aspect ratio which is a bit bizarre (normal TV is 4:3). </p>
