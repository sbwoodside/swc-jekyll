title: jargon is useful 
---


I was just reading <a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/blog/">Larry Borsato's blog </a>(from seeing the Communitech <a href="http://chapter3waterloo.blogspot.com/">Chapter 3 blog </a>...) and I saw his <a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/blog/archives/001680.html">post about jargon </a>. Jargon actually does have a useful function as culture. For example, recently I've been writing a business plan for my company and I've had to learn some new words, like valuation. Valuation is a bit of a jargon word since it really means the appraised price. The person on the street knows what "appraised price" means but not "valuation" ... but that's actually valuable because it's a cultural clue. If I go up to someone and start talking about valuations it tells them that I know about business culture, VC culture, and whatever. 

The same thing goes for social culture... if I start talking about chavs to someone, they would probably assume I'm british (I'm not but I think it's a funny word). 

There's also another strictly practical use. If I type <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=valuation">"valuation" </a>or some other jargon-term into google, I will restrict the field of the search to the cultural context I'm interested in, in this case, business planning, VCs, M&amp;A, etc. If I put in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=appraised+price">"appraised price" </a>or even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=value">"value" </a>I would get something different.
