title: I can't get enough of ravenblack quizzes!

I just can't get enough of these <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/">ravenblack.net </a>quizzes! They're so awesome! The author is a genius! 

Wait, the author is also really weird and has a <a href="http://blog.ravenblack.net/">RavenBlog </a>! 

While I'm here and screwing around, here's a Googlewhack: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=aquaplane+wimax">aquaplane wimax </a>

Also, I'm redoing some fundamental bits of the XSLT that runs my site, so things might be a bit haywire for a few days.
