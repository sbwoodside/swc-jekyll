title: Massive Change 
---


Massive Change is a web site + travelling museum exhibit (currently in Toronto!) about ... well ... 

They say it's the Future of Global Design but a lot of what's in there I wouldn't say falls under design. They talk for example about <a href="http://www.massivechange.com/man_01.html">dealing with internalization in manufacturing </a>and they also <a href="http://www.massivechange.com/img_01.html">take a walk through the light spectrum </a>and what different kinds of images are good for. The whole thing is very scientific. 

More to the point, while it at first appears superficial, it rewards a deep look at any of the subjects.
