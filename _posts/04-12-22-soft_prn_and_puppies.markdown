title: Soft pr0n and puppies

<img src="/weblog/images/2005/pr0nandpuppy.gif" alt="pr0n and puppy" /><br />OK... technically, this is not pr0n. It's probably about as close as you can possibly get with a bathing suit on and hands off, though. I mean, c'mon. But the real deal is the puppy. What is this? Is the puppy supposed to make it all OK? Is the puppy for women to look at? Is that the idea, that men will get the hussy with her ass in the air and women will get the puppy? And this thing is all over the net. I guess it sells...
