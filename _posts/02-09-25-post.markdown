<p>I just had this crazy idea. Could <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla </a>be the next great word processor? I mean, what is there to a word processor? There's a typing interface, a data format, a display engine, and various support tools. Mozilla is a display engine that follows industry standards very well. Those standards -- especially with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">CSS2 </a>support -- make <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML </a>a fully qualified data format for a word processor. Mozilla has an <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/editor/">HTML editor </a>that could be modified to make a good typing interface, so all that's needed are the support tools. The documents are HTML pages with CSS, so that they can be viewed in any browser, published on the web instantly, and edited in a wide variety of editors as long as they support the standards. </p>
