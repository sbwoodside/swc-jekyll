Some bookmarks are just too good to keep to myself. The <a href="http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/cab/index.htm">Canadian Architect and Builder </a>is an online archive of fully-scanned images of this journal, published between 1888 and 1908. They've got some really beautiful drawings. Run, do not walk, to the "plates" ... the rest is text &amp; ads, which I find a bit dull. But the pictures rock. Especially if you then go and google for the buildings and see what they look like today vs. 100 years ago.
