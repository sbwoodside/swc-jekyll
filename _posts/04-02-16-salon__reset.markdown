title: salon, 3600 reset
---
<p>I got a "free gift subscription" to salon that I can give away. If you're a close friend or family ;-) email me if you want it. I don't know how long it's for though. Also I soft-reset my Nokia 3600 using <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1004168.html">Russell Beattie's </a>instructions. Hopefully it will fix it. It was just randomly disconnecting calls for the last few days. </p>
