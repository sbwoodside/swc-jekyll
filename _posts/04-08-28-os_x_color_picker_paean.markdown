title: OS X color picker paean 
---
<p>Yes, it truly is cool: <a href="http://www.codepoetry.net/archives/2004/08/02/the_colors.php">paean on the OS X color picker </a>. </p><p>Bonus: <a href="http://exordium.concepthouse.com/">Christopher Holland </a>posted an OS X color list (.clr file) that you can just copy into the Library/Colors folder on your disk and it will update the colors palette with a new list: the entire list of "Resene" colours from X11. While that might seem lame on the face, it's a totally great list, with for example, the following shades of gold: </p><ul><li>gold drop </li><li>gold tips </li><li>golden bell </li><li>golden dream </li><li>golden fizz </li><li>golden glow </li><li>golden sand </li><li>golden tainoi </li></ul><p>What's more incredible - that they have 8 shades of gold or that someone gave them all different names? Anyway, he <a href="http://exordium.concepthouse.com/archives/2004/02/">blogged his work </a>or you can avoid the wacky CSS layout and <a href="http://exordium.concepthouse.com/archives/Resene.clr.sit">download the .clr file directly </a>. </p>
