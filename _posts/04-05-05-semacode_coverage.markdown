title: semacode coverage 
---


I <a href="http://semacode.org/weblog/archive/2004/05/04">released semacode </a>a few days ago. And it's been pretty well received so far. Here's a round up of the coverage. 

<a href="http://www.wirelessmoment.com/2004/05/simon_woodside_.html">Reiter's Camera Phone Report </a>was first out of the block. I like Alan and his weblog so I put him in the first wave of announcement emails. He emailed me back with some questions which he added to the report. And my name is in the headline :-) Next up was <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/003139.html">Smart Mobs </a>. I emailed Howard Rheingold but he must be busy because it was posted by someone else. Howard's been a fan from early on of the whole idea. Rafe at <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news.php?id=22885">All About Symbian </a>gave me a write up and posted a semacode for their site too. 

The second wave had <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/05/04/cameraphone_barcode_.html">Boing Boing </a>with a short write up. Probably most of today's hits came from there. It's a pretty popular site. Although I haven't actually checked yet. Also the story was picked up by <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100600&amp;ref=1035318">TheFeature's Eric Lin </a>which is cool because I like thefeature. And I didn't directly contact them myself so that's a good sign too. They also provided some highly accurate background info which was missing from other coverage so far. I was also contacted today by heise.de so we'll see if something comes from them. Since my site is still operational I'm assuming there's no /. link yet. So far AxKit is holding up just fine which is great. 

A little bit more. Some linkage and commentary from <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/apps/semacode.html">MobileWhack </a>: "Semacode is about as cool an app as I've come across ... You can be sure I'll be sporting the semacode equivalent of http://www.mobilewhack.com/ on the back of my scooter helmet -- talk about mobile whackery." <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3982212676619745/">engadget </a>has a story also.
