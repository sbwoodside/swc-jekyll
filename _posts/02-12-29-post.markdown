I finally grokked the difference between XSL and XSLT. XSLT is a subset of XSL that is just for transforming XML into different XML. That's basically what I'm using (XSLT). XSL adds a lot of other stuff for styling documents. I'm not using any of that (right now anyway...) and plan to continue to use CSS for presentation purposes.
