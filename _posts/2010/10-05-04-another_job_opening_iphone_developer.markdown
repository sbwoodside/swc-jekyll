title: Another job opening :-) iPhone developer â€“ learn on the job
---


My iPhone custom software development business is expanding yet again and we need more part-time programmers. The <a href="/weblog/2010/2/11/job_opening_iphone_parttime_contract/">last round</a> I hired two people, now we need more. Our recent apps include Unitron's uHear to test your hearing, OurKids, the Kik chat app, and others.

You must:

<ul><li>know C, C++, pointers, object and object-relational patterns already</li><li>be ready to learn the iPhone SDK fast (we'll help)</li></ul>

I've personally been programming on the Cocoa SDK since 1998 back when it was called OpenStep, so if you can pick things up, we can get you up to speed in a few weeks.

Demonstrate your qualifications by answering 2 out of these 3 tricky questions:

[Question 1] (C Pointers) Here is some slightly odd C code, but it will produce an (int) result, provided that you make some small changes in order to make it compile. What is the result going to be, and why?

<pre>int * a = 1990;
int result = &amp;5[a];</pre>

[Question 2] (Database design) Create an entity-relationship diagram for a small subset of the Facebook database. In particular, include in your diagram:

<ul><li>User</li><li>Photo (including who is tagged in the photo)</li><li>Wall Post</li></ul>

Focus on the relationships/associations between these three objects, and only include one or two of the most important static fields (like a person's name). Make sure to indicate the cardinality of a relationship e.g. one-to-one/one-to-many/etc.

To get an idea of what I'm looking for see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model</a>

Here's a tool you can use to draw it online: <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a>. Then just send me a screenshot. Or feel free to use ASCII art or draw on a piece of paper and photograph/scan, as long as it's very clear.

[Question 3] (C++ Objects) The C++ program below has just 2 compile time errors, 1 runtime error, and there is 1 single line missing. Send us a fixed version that compiles and runs correctly. The errors will test your knowledge of object use and management in C++, and the missing line will test you on abstract/virtual inheritance.

SEND TO: simon@semacode.com. Include your answer(s) and some source code that you have written, whether it's open source, for assignments, for fun, or whatever.

REMUNERATION: Competitive.
