title: Reboot videos 
---


Reboot is a tiny little conference held in Denmark somewhere, but they got all kinds of cool speakers this year and <a href="http://www.reboot.dk/reboot6/video/">made videos </a>of them all. Based on the <a href="http://tveskov.com/reboot6.asp">cartoon summary </a>I I wanted to watch the video of <a href="http://www.freecache.org/http://reboot.linuxfinn.dk/timoreilly.mov">Tim O'Reilly </a>s talk. It was good .. I recommend it. He talked about open source, and the move from software- oriented world to a data-oriented world.
