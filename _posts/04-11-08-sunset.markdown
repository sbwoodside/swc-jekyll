Not bad eh? The large sized image is HUGE... it's amazing that megapixel really does mean big. Now, it has artifacts in the dark parts of the image which I attribute to low light. I can't remember if I had night mode on or not (I think not, it seems to be geared towards REALLY dark shots). For the small sized one here, I applied some blur before I shrunk the image to make the house look better. </p>
