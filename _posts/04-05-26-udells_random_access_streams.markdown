title: udell's random access streams 
---
<p>Jon Udell is trying to figure out how to get <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/05/26.html#a1009">random access to video streams </a>off the net. He seems to have gotten somewhere using, amazingly, <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL </a>. </p>
