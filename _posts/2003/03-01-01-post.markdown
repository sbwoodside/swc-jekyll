I just switched the <a href="/projects/ituwblog/">IT@UW weblog </a>over the <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit </a>. So now it has the three most recent entries on the "front" page and the "archives" page has the complete set of entries. The data is being stored in the archives page and pulled from there to the front page using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT </a>.
