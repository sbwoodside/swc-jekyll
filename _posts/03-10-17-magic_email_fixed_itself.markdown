title: magic email fixed itself 
---


My email magically fixed itself today. The estimable Mr. <a href="http://paulschreiber.com/">Paul Schreiber </a>is a bit miffed because he lost his error logs and now he won't get a chance to yell at Yahoo! or the Mail.app team or whoever was responsible for my emotional distress.
