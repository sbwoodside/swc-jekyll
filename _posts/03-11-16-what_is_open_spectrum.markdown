title: What is open spectrum 
---
<p>I just had this brainstorm that open spectrum should be thought of like an open source license. So that, the government would issue an open spectrum license for anyone to use a specific technology (e.g. spread spectrum) on a specific set of frequencies (e.g. 2.4GHz). But what would be the "Free Software Guidelines" for open spectrum? What is <strong>essential </strong>and what isn't to have open spectrum. If you're interested in the intersection of open source and open spectrum, check out (and reply to please :-) my <a href="http://openict.net/pipermail/openspectrum/2003-November/000080.html">post </a>on the <a href="http://openict.net/projects/openspectrum/">Open Spectrum </a>mailing list at <a href="http://openict.net/">OpenICT.net </a>. </p>
