<a href="http://www.developmentgateway.org/node/133831/sdm/docview?docid=544980">Improving internet access in developing countries </a>is a special report from the Development Gateway. It's special to me because they included my paper on Wi-Fi for rural communities. You can look at <a href="http://www.developmentgateway.org/node/133831/sdm/blob?pid=5611">their copy </a>(PDF) or at <a href="/projects/ict/ruralwifi.html">my copy </a>(HTML).
