title: the latest in web oddities 
---


I was snooping through my logs last night and I found the following oddities. Search terms (in google): <code>retractable claws </code>will bring up my page on Roarians, in my ever popular (actually surprisingly...) <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/dnd/campaign/sourcebook/sourcebook.html?rootid=roarians">Edion Sourcebook </a>; <code>km vs miles </code>and all the variants you can think of bring dozens a day to <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/dnd/campaign/sourcebook/sourcebook.html?rootid=ch8">another part of the sourcebook </a>; surprisingly my <code>nokia hs-4w </code>review brings in a few dozen more, in fact <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/weblog/2005/01/31">my review </a>is apparently the 2nd most popular page on the site at the moment. 

I really ought to automate the popularity list. But anyway, the top 5 most popular pages here to date this month ... skipping the root and the weblog ...<ol><li><a href="http://simonwoodside.com/dev/symbian/howto.html">symbian/linux howto </a></li><li><a href="http://simonwoodside.com/weblog/2005/01/31">HS-4W review </a></li><li><a href="http://simonwoodside.com/dnd/campaign/sourcebook/sourcebook.html">the sourcebook </a></li><li><a href="http://simonwoodside.com/fractaltrees/">the fractal trees software page </a></li><li>and finally, the <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/weblog/2005/01/08">photoshop forensics thing </a></li></ol>
