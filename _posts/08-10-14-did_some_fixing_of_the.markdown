title: Did some fixing of the site, and got some comments!
---
<p>Well I just cleaned up some bugs in the site, mainly in the static content area (so stuff in the <a href="/software/">Software</a> and <a href="/content/">Content</a> sections works now!!!)</p><p>Also I got some comments. For some reason I was scared of having comments on the site back in the day, but now... whatever. So I have some comments about good old FractalTreesX <a href="/weblog/2003/12/17/new_fractaltreesx">here</a> and <a href="/weblog/2008/9/27/useful_software_pdfcrack_maphamilton_imapper/">here</a>.</p><p>Now I just need to restore all my old tags... and fix the previous/next navigation system so it's more prominent... and see if my google rank recovers...</p>
