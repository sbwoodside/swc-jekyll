title: 'Useful software: PDFCrack, Map.Hamilton iMapper, and Skim for PDF annotation'
---
<p>Some miscellaneous useful software.</p><p>"Forget" your PDF password: use <a href="http://pdfcrack.sourceforge.net/">open-source PDFCrack</a>. Installs easily on Mac command line (use gmake).</p><p>Looking for high-quality maps and "satellite" imagery of Hamilton? Try <a href="http://map.hamilton.ca/">Map.Hamilton's iMapper</a>. The interface takes a few minutes of experimentation to figure out, and then it's cool. Make sure you switch to Aerial Viewer (latest year) to get their ground imagery, which I think is actually generated by airplanes. It's quite a bit higher resolution than Google Earth has.</p><p>Want to annotate your PDF files? Try <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/">Skim</a>. Seems potentially easier than using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>... (and cheaper...)</p>
