Some friends of mine have been interviewing at Google and I've been helping them prepare. After some practice interviews, I drew up this flowchart for them to take with them (mentally) to the interviews.

Google uses "oral exam" type interviews:

<ul><li> The <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html">best preparation guide is by Steve Yegge</a>.</li><li>You can pretty much ignore all the official guides that Google provides.</li><li>Expect tough questions of the type that you would have received in your advanced CS classes.</li><li>You can also mine programming contests for good questions.</li><li>Another good source of questions is <a href="http://www.mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/Issues/mn10704/googlequestions.php">this <em>math</em>News question list</a>.</li></ul>

For another strategy, pull out your copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">CLR(S)</a> (you do have a copy, right?) and re-learn everything. It's all fair game in a google interview.

After you start reviewing, you must do practice interviews. Invite a friend over to ask you questions. Here is what they have to do:

<ol><li>Pick a challenging question and read it to you.</li><li>Not give you any help at all. </li><li>Ask for a solution in pseudo-code. When you provide it, ask for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">order of magnitude runtime</a> analysis.</li><li>If you make a mistake, after a while, they should say "are you sure that's correct?"</li><li>If you don't give the optimal solution, they should let you develop it, and when you're done, say "do you think there's a better way to do it?"</li></ol>

Believe it or not, interviewing someone isn't a fun as you think, so provide them with beer and/or pizza. Meanwhile you must do your work on a whiteboard. If you don't have one, use a flip-chart or as a last resort paper.

Trust me, answering questions in real time on a white board isn't like doing them in your head. You must practice this or you're going to mess up the interview. Practice with a friend!

Finally, use the interview flowchart to answer the questions:

<ul><li>The first, simplest solution just has to work. Don't worry about runtime at this point.</li><li>Start with pseudocode. Only real code if they ask for it.</li><li>Do a bunch of examples. Make up some sample data and run through it by hand. This will help you understand the problem better, even if you think you already do.</li><li>Once you complete a simple (slow) solution, prove it works and then move on to making it faster.</li></ul>

If you do well, the interviewer will tell you you're done before you run out of time. Good luck!
