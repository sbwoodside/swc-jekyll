title: The "quest for colour" 
---


Although I love graphic design, I've never been able to get the hang of colour. I usually work in black and white. My colour palettes usually suck. The colours on this site are nice but that's a very lengthy evolution and they could still be better. 

Now if I ever need a colour palette I'll just go to this flickr set by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theunholytrinity/">lunaryuna </a>called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theunholytrinity/sets/371908/">quest for colour </a>. It's bloody brilliant.
