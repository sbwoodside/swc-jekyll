title: wireless-longhaul mailing list 
---


My goal with the <a href="http://openict.net/projects/wireless-longhaul/">wireless-longhaul </a>mailing list was to create a truly global list for discussing Wi-fi over long distances. Urban and rural. This month there was an exchange that I think shows it's worked at least somewhat. Looking at whois and google, one poster is from Istanbul, one is I think in Congo, one is in New Zealand and another is in California. Four people, four continents, and all different kinds of society.
