title: Virtual PC icons 
---


If like me you are forced to use Virtual PC, well maybe you still remember the good old days of Connectix. Back in those days VPC was like a badge of honour for Mac users, that a Mac company could be so clever to make it work. And you could install Linux on VPC and stick it to the man. Well, now you have to pay M$ cash to get the software but you don't have to put up with having their beige boxes and logo sitting in your dock any more. Introducing <a href="http://www.sadeem.net/tux.html">Tux'n'tosh </a>, the perfect icon set for VPC. Personally, I chose this icon and now my screen is free of beige boxes once again.
