title: Wi-Fi signal strength vs. channel 
---


I was having all kinds of trouble with my Airport base station, the signal just wasn't cutting through the house and I would keep losing my signal and Mail would just complain and Camino would complain etc. So I switched the channel from 11 to 6, and now, no problem. I have four bars where I used to have nothing.
