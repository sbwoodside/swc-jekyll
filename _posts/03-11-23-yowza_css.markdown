<p>IE for Windows' problems would be cute if it wasn't so popular. So it turns out that @import directives in a CSS file aren't supported in IE... if they contain a media type. Which mine did ... so anyone looking at parts of the site in IE was getting a seriously garbled output. Well, I "checked" in Virtual PC just to be sure things were looking OK and they weren't. Now it's fixed. I still love that <a href="/projects/ict">shade of red </a>. </p>
