title: Nokia will make a Series 60 phone with QWERTY keyboard
---
<p>I was just listening to <a href="http://www.talkpoint.com/content/17720C7F-49B7-4601-9993-DF7181F618CB/118F8CF9-C215-424F-AD5C-10C8D5FEEE85/C67A2554-9DBB-4AFC-B738-DAC4D55705D6/2/StreamingMetaFiles/slide001.rpm">Antti Vasara's talk (realaudio) </a>from <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=NOK&amp;ampscript=11903&amp;item_id=%27nokia_hosted_pres.html%27">Nokia 2004 Capital Market Days </a>. It's not on the slides but during the talk he said that </p><blockquote>there will be Series 60 phones with QWERTY keyboards </blockquote>Will these be shaped like the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,47814,00.html">Nokia 6820 </a>? Certainly when Series 60 gains the ability to flip from horizontal to vertical, which will happen I guess in the next year, a Series 60 phone in that form factor seems likely.
