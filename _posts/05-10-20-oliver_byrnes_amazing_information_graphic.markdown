<div class="floating_right"><a href="/weblog/images/2005/byrne.gif"><img src="/weblog/images/2005/byrne.gif" width="150" /></a></div><p>Oliver Byrne ("Surveyor of Her Majesty's settlements in the Falkland Islands and author of numerous mathematical works") made a masterpiece of information graphics in 1847, giving forth the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Elements of Euclid </a>in a visual format. </p><p>You can see the whole entire thing (OK, actually just the first 6 books, but isn't that enough?) at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia </a>s <a href="http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/byrne.html">Oliver Byrne's edition of Euclid </a>site. The pictures are very cool. </p>
