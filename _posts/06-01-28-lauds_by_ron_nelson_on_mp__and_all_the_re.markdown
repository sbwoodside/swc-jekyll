You can download it yourself from the <a href="http://www.farragutband.org/media.htm">Farragut High School </a>band website: <a href="http://www.farragutband.org/media/festival/2003-%20Ron%20Nelson-Lauds.mp3">Lauds by Ron Nelson MP3 file </a>. I'd say that the recording is a bit muddy but you can get the sense of what the song is all about. The Farragut band makes a fair number of errors. For me I've been having trouble with the crazy time changes and a bit of a tricky part on Vibraphone and Marimba. </p><p>The part also calls for <a href="http://www.bellperc.com/specialist/crotales.htm">Crotales </a>at parts, and boy do they cut through! Since we don't have crotales, I switched to playing the vibes with brass mallets to get the same effect. I'm also playing at the very top of the range since crotales are written two octaves below their actual pitch. But I'm off the top on one note :-( </p><p>For <b>Children's March </b>by Percy Grainger, the <a href="http://www.calgaryconcertband.com/Sound_clips.html">Calgary Concert Band </a>has an <a href="http://www.calgaryconcertband.com/sound/Children_Grainger.mp3">excerpt of Children's March </a>that's neatly executed and quiet too (compared to our 100 piece band anyway...). It seems impossible to find a full recording of the piece, but here's another excerpt: <a href="http://www.cornerstone.edu/music/ensembles/windEnsemble.htm">Cornerstone University </a>plays an <a href="http://media.gospelcom.net/cornerstone/musicdept/SW/Childrens%20March%20Excerpt.mp3">excerpt of Children's March MP3 </a>. </p><p>Next up in the repertoire - <b>Shenandoah </b>by Frank Tipeli. For you, I have a recording by the <a href="http://www.asband.org/sounds/">Austin Symphonic Band </a>. It's not perfect but you can't have everything... <a href="http://www.asband.org/sounds/shenandoah.mp3">Shenandoah MP3 </a>. </p><p>There's one more, what is it? Oh yeah, <b>Original Suite </b>by Gordon Jacob. Not a difficult recording to find, this one. Popular piece. I'll give you a few. First, <a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/windsymphony/Music.html">Duke University </a>who put in a good show but the recording isn't so great ... echoey and remote. But you can tell it's a fine performance. <a href="http://www.duke.edu/web/windsymphony/music/Gordon%20Jacob%20-%20Original%20Suite.mp3">Duke's Original Suite MP3 </a>. And then as the last hurrah, here's the <a href="http://www.rockfordwindensemble.org/soundclips.htm">Rockford Wind Ensemble </a>s take, neaty cut off in the middle: <a href="http://www.rockfordwindensemble.org/sound/RWE%2010-30-05/An%20Original%20Suite.MP3">Rockford's Original Suite MP3 </a>. </p>
