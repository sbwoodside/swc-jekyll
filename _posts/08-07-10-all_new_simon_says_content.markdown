<p>Wow, WYM Editor is so cool that I can just like type in a new blog post whenever I want to. Wild!</p><p>So anyway, I've been saving up a whole load of links and stuff for months until I had this new site all sorted out. So here's something.</p><p>Hmm... where did my "stuff to blog about" folder go?</p><p>Oh, here's an awesome one. <a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/special/teardown/">Nikkei Electronics Teardown Squad</a>. These guys kick ass. Watch as they take apart a MacBook Air and declare "<a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20080220/147736/">No Waste Outside, Nothing but Waste Inside</a>".</p><blockquote><p>About 30 screws were used to attach the keyboard alone. "The total number of screws in the MacBook Air was several times the number used in a PC we make," one of the engineers said. </p></blockquote><p>Burn, baby, burn!</p><p>OK, here's another one from the files. <a href="http://nathanfowkes.blogspot.com/">Nathan Fawkes Art</a>. He's part of a network of film animators and illustrators and concept artists who all have their stuff up on blogspot.</p><p>And I'd like to remind myself particularly about <a href="http://nathanfowkes.blogspot.com/2008/02/science-fiction.html">this post about science fiction</a>.</p>
