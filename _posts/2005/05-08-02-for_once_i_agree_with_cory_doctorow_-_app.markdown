title: For once I agree with Cory Doctorow - Apple's DRM is no good 
---


<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/31/apple_to_add_trusted.html">Cory dumps on Apple's decision to use Hardware DRM in OS X </a>. Cory is smart but sometimes I think he's dead wrong about stuff. OK, mobile phones and mobile computing specifically. But I have to say that I share his dislike of Apple's move to hardware DRM in the official developer version of OS X on Intel. It's nasty. It's not right. It shouldn't be done. 

Basically, if Apple releases new Macs with hardware DRM I will have to seriously consider switching to Linux. I just can't handle the idea that someone else gets to decide if I can use my computer and what I can do with it. What I install on it, what applications I get to run, and which I don't. It's my machine. 

My prediction is that Apple WILL ship with some form of Hardware DRM. My HOPE is that it won't work. If it doesn't work, I suppose I'll buy it and disable the DRM. 

If it does work? I don't know. That will be not good. 

The problem is of course that I love using the Mac. Apple makes great products. Even the good OSS software that I use - like VLC and Sympa - doesn't have the high quality interface that Apple provides. 

On the other hand, it might be the kick in the ass that OSS needs to get with it and put together quality interface. 

Damn. Well, I'm glad at least that I'm not actually working on Marklar any more, and I don't have to feel like I'm part of this machine that's destroying the world.
