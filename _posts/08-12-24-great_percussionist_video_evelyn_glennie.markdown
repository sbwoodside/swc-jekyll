title: 'Great percussionist video: Evelyn Glennie'
---
<p>Evelyn Glennie is a deaf percussionist. I guess that this is possible because percussion creates vibrations that you can feel with your feet, your hands, your fingertips, maybe even your whole body. She is now one of the few or only professional solo percussionists in the world. Anyway, the TED conference gave her a 30 minute session which is reproduced here in high definition (definitely consider plugging into decent speakers or headphones). <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/evelyn_glennie_shows_how_to_listen.html">Evelyn Glennie on "How to Listen".</a> Click on the High Definition link under the video to get the real video.</p>
