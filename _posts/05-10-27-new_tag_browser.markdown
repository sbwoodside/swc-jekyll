title: New tag browser 
---
<p>My CLEVER little blog now has a <a href="/weblog/tag">better tag browser </a>, more like the one you are used to seeing in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/">flickr </a>and so on. Also the tag browser is finally fixed so that it actually displays all of the tags that I've used... the previous one had a little bug in it, which I will totally blame on the <a href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/sect21.html">XSLT FAQ </a>s article on <a href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N4486.html">Grouping </a>which completely didn't work for me in this case. And their technique made no sense. </p><p>Will I ever release my siteware as open source? It could happen.. I won't say I'm not unmoved by gifts of small and valuable precious stones. Actually, I really ought to just do it. Bleh. </p><p>And finally, I still need to go through and tag some more actually.. but what I'm thinking of doing now is tagging the whole site and making RSS available for the whole site as well. </p>
