title: Jason Garlough is back on the map 
---


I lived across the hall from Jason Garlough in first year university. In second year we stayed connected but then he kind of drifted off (to be a tin-smith, I think actually) ... didn't much like UW I guess and well, neither did I but I missed my cue. So now you know who's the wiser one. 

Anyway he's back... <a href="http://jgarlough.blogspot.com/">Jason Garlough's weblog </a>. It's ok.. some interesting pictures and layout. Garlough had the most amazing webpage back in 1997 although it has sadly passed away. This one's OK too.
