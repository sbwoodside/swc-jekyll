After reading [this Sunday Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html) by Ron Suskind I realized that the best explanation for W's behaviour is that he believes what he says. In this light, I put together this [information graphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_graphics) of what he believes the world to be like. I don't endorse this world view; it is constructed based on the best available evidence from transcripts of his speeches and media reports. I do not believe that any of this material is controversial. If you have additional information, please [email me](mailto:sbwoodside@yahoo.com?subject=W%20believes) .
