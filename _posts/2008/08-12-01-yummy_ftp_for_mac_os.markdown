title: 'Yummy FTP for Mac OS X: still good, still ignored'
---


<a href="http://www.yummysoftware.com/">Yummy FTP is a great Mac FTP program with side-by-side browsing, sychronization, remote editing, etc</a>. I'm not a huge fan of the icon but other than that it's great.

So <a href="http://macapper.com/2007/05/24/review-top-3-mac-ftp-apps/">why do people keep ignoring it</a>?
