title: Maemo is coming
---


So according to what <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/report-nokia-lean-linux-smartphone-battle/2009-08-26">everybody is saying</a>, Nokia is going to start using the <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo operating system + SDK </a>in their high-end smartphones. This is good news. Symbian is basically a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/mobile/Symbian_OS_design_faults.aspx">smoking</a> pile of <a href="http://spellcoder.com/blogs/tayseer/archive/2007/03/01/6033.aspx">junk</a>. It's too old, and too crap, to be fixed. Toss it out the window and good riddance.

I realize this won't happen overnight, but the sooner we can get a more modern, well-documented, programmer-usable SDK available for Nokia phones the better. Maemo looks good at first blush. You develop on Linux instead of horrible, horrible windows, which is good and means that a proper SDK for Mac is probably possible. You use Qt which is apparently pretty good. So, good news all around.

Nokia needs to fix a lot of other things to keep their game going in the smartphone market. They need to stop messing around with <a href="/weblog/2009/6/4/nokia_blows_it_on_the/">resistive touch screens</a> for one thing. But without a great OS they can't make anything else happen. So, I hope that they follow this up with more symbian abandonment and more alternative awesomeness.

UPDATE: And <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">here it is</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au_uRmoy8Fs">video of N900</a>).
