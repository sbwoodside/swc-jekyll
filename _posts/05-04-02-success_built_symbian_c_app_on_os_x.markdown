title: Success! Built Symbian C++ app on OS X! 
---
<p>Sweet. I just build and installed and ran the series 60 "form" example app .. from Mac OS X! </p><p>I've got more or less complete notes on what I did that I'll post a little later. Now, I can finally get along to building apps that work on Nokia's S60 SDK 2.1 (aka Series 60 platform 2.1, Feature Pack 1). </p>
