<em>I came up with these six conjectures about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia </a>one night. It kept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sbwoodside">me </a>up. I'll admit that some of them are somewhat opaque to a casual reader. I might write some commentary later. </em>

<em>By the way -- I have no idea if any of them are true. </em>

<strong>Conjecture 1. </strong>That the distance between any two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia </a>pages, randomly chosen, as measured by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikilink#Wikilink">wikilinks </a>, is on average 6. 

<strong>Conjecture 2. </strong>That wikipedia is sufficiently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system">formal </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete">complete </a>that you could build a useful general purpose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base">knowledge </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation">base </a>using it. 

<strong>Conjecture 3. </strong>That wikipedia has low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy">information entropy </a>. 

<strong>Conjecture 4. </strong>That the development of a wikipedia article over time occurs in a manner consistent to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">biological evolution </a>of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species">species </a>. 

<strong>Conjecture 5. </strong>That the relationship between the amount of material in wikipedia and the number of article views is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%27s_law">exponential </a>. 

<strong>Conjecture 6. </strong>That wikipedia is, on average, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact">factually accurate </a>.</div>

<em>Motivational questions: </em>

<ol><li>Social networks conform to the "six degrees of separation" principle. If wikipedia does, what does that say about its social roots / the way it's constructed? </li><li>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc">Cyc </a>and others. Is there enough formally coded information in wikipedia? What about the semantic relationship between the source sentence containing a link and the summary of the linked article? </li><li>What does "low entropy" mean anyway? More structured? Simpler? More redundant? More readable? What about the entropy across wikilinks? </li><li>Does an article behave like DNA? </li><li>Can we "prove" Reed's law? How do you measure the size of the content? </li><li>Is it accurate more than average? Can you predict the accuracy of an article? </li></ol>
