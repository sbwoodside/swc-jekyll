title: Quick uptake for Symbian Linux 
---


That was quick. Is there some kind of unmet, pent up demand for Symbian Linux solutions? My <a href="http://www.simonwoodside.com/dev/symbian/howto.html">Symbian / Linux </a>HOWTO is now the #1 result in google if you type in <code>symbian linux </code>or <code>symbian "OS X" </code>. I've had 623 referrals from google so far this month, probably mostly for that. huh.
