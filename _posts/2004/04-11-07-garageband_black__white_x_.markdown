title: 'GarageBand: Black &amp; White X 5'
---


My version of <a href="/weblog/files/sw_black_white_x_5.mp3">Black &amp; White X 5 </a>by Bill Conti. I bought GarageBand as part of the iLife package, more to get the latest iMovie. But last night I fiddled and lifted this song from the Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It's a piece for piano - so I tried to play it on the piano - and then discovered it's actually a piece for five pianos. I don't have a MIDI keyboard so I used <a href="http://www.manyetas.com/creed/midikeys_beta.html">MidiKeys </a>. Follow the link to hear it, 1:10 minutes. LAME encoded. Sigh, the second piano is way too muddy. I'd have to go back in and manually edit the AUMatrixReverb to make it work right. 

And also here is the <a href="/weblog/files/black_and_white_x_5.band.zip">Garageband file </a>.
