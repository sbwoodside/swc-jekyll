I'm not convinced by gamer nerdcore but good CS Geeksta Rap is cool. Finally some street beats that talk to me!

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fow7iUaKrq4">Monzy's Kill -9 (video)</a> is pretty entertaining. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-m6JDYRFvk">Dale Chase Coder Girl</a>. "She's not another shallow copy I can sudo" heheh.

I found a few new lines in a dream recently. Don't know if they'll ever fit into a rap though.

<pre>Java or Scala it doesn't matter to me
If you want I'll even write your app in PHP

10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 GOTO ONE-OH

Your bytecode is subject to my interpretation

Use my RJ-45 I'll put a packet right into your ass

If you don't do what I want then I will fork your git
I'm fully dedicated but you just can't commit</pre>
