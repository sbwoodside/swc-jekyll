<p>Simon Woodside hacks on computers for a living. All of the computers he hacks on are his own. He has done time as a program manager for an operating system that recently won Best Product from the 2002 Technology of the Year awards from InfoWorld. Prior to that he suffered through an education. He currently pursues interests as they come to him, while trying to patch together a workable lifestyle. </p>
