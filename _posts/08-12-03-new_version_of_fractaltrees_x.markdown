title: New version of FractalTrees X (FTX) 2 beta 1
---


So after something on the order of 4 years I've finally upgraded my FTX program that draws fractal trees in 2 dimensions. I'll update the program's home page later, but in the mean time, here's the download link, with source code included.

This has the advantage over the "alpha" in that it actually works the way it's supposed to.

Why am I returning to this after so long? Well, suddenly coding for Macs is cool again, and also I was going to try out MacRuby. So... first get it working in ObjC again I guess, and then we'll see ‰ÛÓ maybe I'll port it to iPhone and sell it for $0.99 a pop :-) :-)

(NB This version probably only works on Intel / 10.5.)
