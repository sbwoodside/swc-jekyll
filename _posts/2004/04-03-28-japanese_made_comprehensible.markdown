title: Japanese made comprehensible 
---
Here's some brilliant stuff from <a href="http://bob.myers.name/blog/">Bob Myers </a>on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5hin </a>(who thought anything useful would <strong>ever </strong>show up there???). It's a primer for <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/26/175722/727">Japanese for Geeks </a>. It presents the japanese language in BNF form and wow, it makes so much sense. You know, I took a year and a half of japanese and never understood the grammar half so well as I'm starting to now. Here's <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/25/32218/1824">the second part </a>and let's hope that he soon delivers part III... and maybe even more?
