title: PTT is stupid and will never be popular

OK, I'm tired and I still haven't really started digging into my email pile, so here's my prediction of the hour. Push To Talk on mobile phones will never be popular. Mobile operators seem to want this to happen, but it's not going to. It's just an unwieldy way to communicate. It will probably keep a niche in field staff verticals but otherwise, forget about it.
