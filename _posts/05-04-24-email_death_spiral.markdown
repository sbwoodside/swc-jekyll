title: email death spiral 
---
<p>I'm caught in an email death spiral. I have so many emails that I can't read them all without some serious pain. So I don't read them. Then more emails come in, and the situation gets worse! </p><p>There's lots of things that I want to do, and that I'm doing, that don't involve reading all that email. If you want to talk to me, email me again. Maybe I'll read it this time! hahaha! </p>
