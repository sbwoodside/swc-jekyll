title: Al Qa Qaa satellite images 
---


I have located the satellite imagery of the Al Qa Qaa that I was looking for while writing this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qa_Qaa_controversy_timeline">timeline at Wikipedia </a>. 

<a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iraq/al_qa_qaa-imagery.htm">GlobalSecurity.org / Public Eye Satellite Imagery of Al Qa Qaa </a>. There are almost 50 satellite photos of the facility there, and they are from 2001.

Most notably, it clearly shows the massive scale of the complex, that the 1,100 building estimate is almost certainly correct. 

DigitalGlobe has also <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/sample_imagery.shtml">posted satellite images </a>of the site, this time, from late 2003 and mid 2004. (warning, 4 and 5.1 MB files)
