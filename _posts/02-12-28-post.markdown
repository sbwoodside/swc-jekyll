<p>You are looking at this index page generated by AxKit. This What's New entry is in XML. You can look at the what's new stuff <a href="/weblog">all by itself </a>, but you'll see HTML there too right now. I'm typing this into my own handrolled XML format that's parsed by three XSL style sheets in a pipeline before being display, all processed courtesy of <a href="http://axkit.org/">AxKit </a>. <br/>By the way, the output appears as HTML 4.01 transitional but I'm moving to an XML backend with XHTML for content for now. I'm just converting it to HTML in the output. </p>
