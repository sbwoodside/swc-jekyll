## The publications

* The [Hamilton Spectator](https://www.thespec.com) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hamilton_Spectator)) has an [average daily readership of around 230,000 people](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-hamilton-spectator/?originalSubdomain=ca) in 2022, and I really get a kick out of being published in it. I actually interned there as a high school student in the 90s.

* The [Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Star)) [reported in 2016] readership of 1 million in print and 1 million online.
