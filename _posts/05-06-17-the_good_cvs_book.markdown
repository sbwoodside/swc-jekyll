title: The good CVS book 
---


There is one good online CVS guide and manual, and it's this one: <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">Open Source Development With CVS </a>. It's also a real book, and although the version I'm pointing you to may well be not the latest edition, it's still really, really good.
