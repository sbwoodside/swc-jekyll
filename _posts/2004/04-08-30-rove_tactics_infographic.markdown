title: Rove tactics infographic 
---


Here's an image I prepared based on a story about Karl Rover's smear campaign tactics in <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/08/28/moore_rove_swift_boat/index.html">salon.com </a>. My graphic illustrates the story's claims. I haven't personally fact-checked it at all. 

I deliberately chose salon colours and I obviously have higher-resolution versions available.
