title: FTXSaver alpha 4
---


I just posted another alpha of the screen saver. This one fixes the anti-aliasing problem and adds a requested feature to speed up colour animation. <a href="/fractaltrees/ftxsaver">Get it here. </a>

I also posted some new gallery images. It really doesn't compare to seeing the thing in operation, but maybe you can get a taste for what it looks like. <a href="/fractaltrees/gallery/screensaver/2004_01_12">See more. </a>

By the way the nifty gallery widget is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Enikc/AxKit-App-Gallery-0.4/">AxKit::App::Gallery </a>by Nik Clayton. It caches the thumbnails at smaller sizes to give the downloads a break, and it generates them automatically as well, so less work for me.
