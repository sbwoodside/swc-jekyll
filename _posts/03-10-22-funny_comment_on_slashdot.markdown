From Apple, we want the entire world to seem a little friendlier and cooler with every product release, every dot-incremenent OS update. They both disappoint us, but the expectations seem a little different... </p></blockquote><p>In fact there's lots of good comments in this <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/22/1727208&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=181">story </a>about the VT Mac OS X (!!!) supercomputer (by the way it's running Mac OS X !!!!) </p>
