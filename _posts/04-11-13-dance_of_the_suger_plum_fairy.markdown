title: Dance of the Suger Plum Fairy 
---


I always liked this song. Now I can play it (I mean the full orchestra version ;-) <a href="/weblog/files/sugerplum.mp3">The first 4 bars </a>(repeated 5 times). Performed by yours truly, on my powerbook keyboard, with Garageband, MidiKeys, the Steel Xylophone SoundFont from <a href="http://www.hammersound.net/">HammerSound </a>(free), the Pizzato Strings sound from the QT library, which is lame but I can't find a SoundFont for it yet. I didn't use any quantization in order to get that live performance feel to it. I mixed the stereo so that it's like a real orchestra - Violins on the left, Cellos on the right. The Celesta is in the middle though, since it's solo. The sheet music is from <a href="http://www.mfiles.co.uk/sheet-music.htm">mfiles </a>(also free), that's what I worked from. <a href="http://hector.ucdavis.edu/Music10/Syllabus/Lectures/orch.htm">The Orchestra Layout </a>image file. The piece, is by Tchaikovsky.
