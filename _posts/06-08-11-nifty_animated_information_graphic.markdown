title: nifty animated information graphic 
---
<p><a href="http://www.tenthdimension.com/">Imagining the Tenth Dimension </a>is a cool, flash-animated information graphic. Unlike a lot of flash graphics, this one really needs to be animated, the movement really adds to the explanation power of the graphic. </p><p>After watching it, you're supposed to understand why "String Theory" has ten dimensions and what they are. In theory, anyway. </p>
