I just spent like an hour debugging this stupid problem with a resource file for symbian. Turns out when you get this error:

<pre>&lt;empty&gt;(0) : Link name not found </pre>

you have avkon.rsg included BEFORE avkon.rh. You need to include them in the OTHER order. At least now it will be in google.
