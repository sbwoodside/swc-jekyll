title: The racism hidden in your camera

Racism is a human trait, but machines are impartial, operating in a separate realm. So it is usually thought. But as our machines become more automated, more intelligent, in a word "smarter", they also become more human. And those human attributes reflect the attributes of their creators. Product designers create machines in their own image. And sometimes those designers themselves have traits that are less than desirable, or they are driven by corporate motives to optimize for profit—profit from certain people with certain colour of skin—because they are more able to pay, or simply from lack of knowledge.

But can a machine be racist? Virtually everyone reading this can conduct an experiment of their own to find out the truth or falsehood of this question. Simply take your camera, whether it be an iOS or Android "smart" phone, or a higher-end dedicated model, and take two pictures, one of a white person, and one of a person who is black.

I was reminded of this when I opened the newspaper today—my parents still get a paper copy—and looked at two photographs on nearby pages. One, a white man, one black. Here they are. See if you can spot the racism inherent in the pictures.

TODO

If you can't spot it, don't worry, I spent many years learning a great deal about the details of camera function on behalf of one of my startups, which attuned me to these details. Simply put, the white man's face is clear and easy to see, while the black man's face is dark and hard to make out.

This is not an editorial error of the newspaper, it's a result of the way that current cameras work. Camera makers know that most photos are of people and so they apply some technology to make the face, in particular, properly exposed. The camera uses face-recognition software to find the face and then it makes adjustments to the shutter speed, light balance, aperture, in order to give the face a good contrast and brightness. It will sacrifice other parts of the image, making them too dark or too light. This all follows well from neuroscience, which has found that 80% TODO of our visual processing system is oriented towards face recognition. (That is why we see faces in clouds and pieces of toast TODO LINK.)

So when the white man's face has good contrast, and the black man's face is too dark and hard to make out, we can trace that back to the software. Its designers prioritized white people and de-prioritized everyone else. This is even known in within the very specialized sub-industry that creates these algorithms. But it's not something that the average person would have heard of. In fact, when I've brought this to the attention of friends, family and colleagues, they have uniformly never even considered the possibility that a camera could have racism embedded right into its core software.

If there's a lesson here, it's that racism is all-pervasive. It's not just about police violence, seats on buses, preferential treatment at work. It's not a few bad apples. It goes deep, very deep, so deep that it's contained in a the device that almost everyone in the world TODO LINK has in their pocket. That's something to think about next time you take a picture.

Next time you take a picture, perhaps take time to reflect on what a small thing a camera is, and where else it might be hiding.
