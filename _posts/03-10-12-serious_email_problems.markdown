title: serious email problems 
---
<p>I'm having serious email problems receiving email. I just got off the phone with one of Apple's OS engineers who also happens to be a friend ;-) and we've determined that it's definitely not my fault ;-) I'm blaming both Apple (makers of Mail.app my client) and Yahoo (I use their paid POP access for much of my email) for screwing everything up. Not only is the POP data coming from Yahoo corrupted somehow (we looked at the protocol stream) but also Mail.app managed to actually DELETE messages and corrupt others. So, if you wrote me in the last 2-3 days, please send it again! I may have lost it... </p><p>Hopefully now I have a relatively safe (but time-intensive) workaround. But I hope that on Monday Paul can kick the *** out of whoever is responsible for this cock up. </p>
