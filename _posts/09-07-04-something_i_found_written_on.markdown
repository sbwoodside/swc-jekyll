title: Something I found written on a piece of paper

I'm not sure if it means anything:

<pre>Existential crisis was<br />written on the egg.<br />I cry sis. Sis is tense. She has<br />no shawl. Where is my shawl?<br />she cries. Perhaps her shawl is<br />partial by now, the cat<br />unwound it an hour ago. The cat<br />in the hat? The very same, and<br />a top hat it is. I am no<br />magician, just a logician, I<br />cannot unravel this riddle cries she.<br />A crisis<br />I say, if the cat is in the hat,<br />a magician's hat will it<br />reveal when the hat I<br />repeal? Simple,<br />says she, by Occam's razor we<br />may cut a hole in the<br />hat and oculate inside. But<br />we have but Occam's hatchet<br />I say, and a blunt tool it is,<br />more liable to crush it. Let us<br />wait and see, cries sis<br />sensing an existential crisis.<br />This interminable solution has left<br />me with no determinable<br />resolution.</pre>
