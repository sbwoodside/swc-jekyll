Yeah, I changed the font from verdana to just sans-serif. That means you, that's right — you! — are now responsible for choosing a good default sans-serif font for your system. If you're on Mac OS X, may I recommend Gills Sans for sans-serif and Hoefler Text for serif? They look very nice. 

These — special ‰ö  characters ‰ö_ brought to you by the letters U, T, F and the number eight. I set the text encoding in my editor and encoding= in the XML header. No character entities have been used in the making of this entry.
