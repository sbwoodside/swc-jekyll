Check out the link. You'll see "thanks to ... simon woodside". I did ton of work on this bookmarks patch. I won't go into the gory details, maybe in a few years. One problem with being a "program manager" (ala Apple and Microsoft) is that you can't take much credit for what you do. Mostly it's "glue" work and we all know how much credit glue gets. I do like to get credit for what I do. So, in that sense, the program manager type role is kind of unfulfilling. 

I don't know really what to do about that. The individuals who I work with / have worked with I think fully appreciate what I do/did as a program manager. And I say "did" because this most recent experience kind of nudged me away from taking on that kind of job again. On the other hand, it's cool to see Camino moving again. I think I played a fairly central role in that.
