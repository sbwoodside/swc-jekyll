title: Camino drawing bug 
---


Mike Pinkerton <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/archives/004391.html">says </a>that he's making some progress on the Panther drawing bug. That's good because any kind of 0.8 release of Camino would have to have that fixed. Also since I don't actually have panther yet, I hope that I don't have to upgrade to look at this problem since I'm still happy waiting for other people to make sure panther doesn't have any big stupid mistakes in it.
