title: AxKit mailing list archives 
---
Google doesn't seem to be able to find these mailing list archives, so... <ul><li><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xml-axkit-dev/">axkit-dev mailing list archive </a>- the only up-to-date archive of axkit-dev@xml.apache.org that I can find. </li><li><a href="http://maclux-rz.uibk.ac.at/maillists/axkit-users/maillist.shtml">axkit-users mailing list archive </a>- this seems to be the best archive of axkit-users@axkit.org. There are others - the official one would be <a href="http://axkit.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi/3">here </a>but it never seems to be up to date at all. </li></ul>
