title: It should be required reading is for idiots
---


Number of books that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22should+be+required+reading%22">"should be required reading"</a>: <strong>855,000</strong>.*

I hate it when people say that something should be required reading. Do you think that your pet crap is something that everyone cares about? I don't give a shit about your agenda.

Here's my list of what should be required reading:

<ul><li>Parts, at least, of the Bible, so that you can see how odd and contradictory it is. The gospels are good though</li><li>A bit of Shakespeare</li><li>Well, that's about it. So long suckers.</li></ul>

* according to Google
