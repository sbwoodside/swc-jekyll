title: weblog archive

I just added more of a <a href="/weblog/archive">proper weblog archive </a>that actually lists out all the entries in a list format, providing link-throughs to each entry on a separate page. Now you can see all of the entries at a glance. It's not as good as a by-the-year / by-the-month view would be, but it's a lot better than what I had before which was just every single entry, full text, all on one page.
