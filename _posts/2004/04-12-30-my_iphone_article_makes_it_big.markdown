title: My iPhone article makes it big 
---


I wrote an article for <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/">MobileWhack </a>with some <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/apple_iphone.html">iPhone predictions </a>. Amazingly enough, I'm now on the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=iphone">first page of google results for "iPhone" </a>(although it may not last).
