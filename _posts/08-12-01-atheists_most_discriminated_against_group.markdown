title: Atheists most discriminated against group in the USA

<p>Hard to believe... But so says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists#United_States">wikipedia</a>. I wonder why this doesn't come up more often. Would being "outed" as an atheist be as bad as being "outed" as gay or muslim or . . . whatever?</p>
