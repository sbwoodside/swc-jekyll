title: W's air guard record in visual format 
---


<strong>Update: There's a <a href="http://simonwoodside.com/weblog/2004/09/07">new version 1.1 </a>now that's a lot easier to read (but shows the same data). </strong>

Here's a visual explanation of W's air national guard record. I used only documents released by the military (in other words, official service documents) to build the graphic.

Also available in best quality: <a href="/weblogs/images/reserves/reserves-1.0.pdf">PDF 1.2 MB </a>. 

Most of the documents I sourced can be found either at <a href="http://users.cis.net/coldfeet/document.htm">coldfeet </a>or through <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2095256/">slate </a>.
