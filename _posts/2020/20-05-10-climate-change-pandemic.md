title: Climate Change and the Covid-19 Pandmic
---

I recently read an [opinion article in the local paper](https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/2020/05/05/we-must-learn-critical-lessons-from-covid-19-about-climate-change.html) arguing – rightly – that that climate change is a much greater threat than the pandemic. But unfortunately it lead off by saying that climate change caused the pandemic.

> Scientists have long told us to be much better prepared for a massive global pandemic.
> We caused it. Too many people are making unsustainable demands on the limited resources of this planet (a.k.a. overshoot). Our current pandemic arises from massive deforestation, habitat fragmentation and increased urbanization.

 I was surprised to read this because I’m an avid science reader and I’ve never read anything to indicate that climate change would cause a pandemic illness. Certainly many other health problems, but not a pandemic. The article didn’t cite any sources so I can’t verify based on that, but I have done my own quick search and found that there’s no connection.

For example, Scientific American article, [Climate Change and Infectious Diseases](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/climate-change-and-infectious-diseases/) from April 9, 2020, by Arthur Wyns, a climate change advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO), says:

> There is also no evidence that climate change made the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 more likely.

In terms of scholarly articles, I just did a quick scan of the results of searching [Google Scholar for “climate change pandemic”](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=climate+change+pandemic&btnG=) and I don’t see any articles that clearly link the two.

* Carlson, Colin J., Eric R. Dougherty, and Wayne Getz. "[An ecological assessment of the pandemic threat of Zika virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001720/)." PLoS neglected tropical diseases 10.8 (2016).:

  > most notably, the role of climate change in Zika’s expansion has not yet been thoroughly investigated.

* Curseu, Daniela, et al. "[Potential impact of climate change on pandemic influenza risk](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1017-2_45)." Global Warming. Springer, Boston, MA, 2010. 643-657.:

  > The evolution of these viral diseases was probably not directly affected by climate change. ... 
  > However, for global warming, there has not been any evidence to show that it makes human influenza pandemics more likely.

This is just a quick scan, but it leads me to think that there isn’t a scientifically validated connection.

As a climate change activist, I think it’s most important to always maintain a faithfulness to the science, because science is the best way that humans have developed to find the truth, and science is how we know the climate crisis is real. So I think it’s particularly important that climate change activists are faithful to the science even if that weakens the argument.

There is still a strong connection between pandemic and climate change, because the COVID-19 response shows that we can collaborate globally to fight a global crisis, and so it’s a good dry run for more intense climate action. Like many, I hope that we can build on this and pivot from pandemic into full-on climate crisis mode.
