title: the band's new repertoire 
---
<p>Here's some recordings I found out there on the web for our new repertoire. Unfortunately the Hannaford Overture (which I quite like, by Canadian J. Scott Irvine), and Dance Sequence (by Marco PÃŒ_tz) I can't find. </p><p><strong>Pageant </strong>(by Vincent Persichetti) - I think I'm going to like this one. I've got a couple of recordings for you. The first one is the Northwestern University Symphonic Ensemble and it was played on <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/13838">Stochastic Hit Parade with Bethany Ryker </a>on WFMU in NYC. In real audio format, and the piece in question is from 0:00 to 7:21 so ignore everything after that. <a href="http://wfmu.org/listen.ram?show=13838&amp;drop=11">RAM link to Pageant </a></p><p>The other recording is from the <a href="http://www.ric.edu/miric/concert-audio.htm">Rhode Island College Wind Ensemble </a>s recording: <a href="http://www.ric.edu/miric/audio/21-Pageant.mp3">Pageant - mp3 </a>A fine recording but it's either cut off or only the first movement. </p><p><strong>The Vanished Army </strong>(by Kenneth J. Alford) - Traditional sort of march. Recording is from the <a href="http://www.garlandisdschools.net/austin/onstage.html">Austin Academy </a>... <a href="http://www.garlandisdschools.net/austin/audio/Vanished_Army.mp3">vanished Army in mp3 </a></p><p><strong>Armenian Dances </strong>(by Aram Khachaturian) - Coming back to Canada I found a recording by the <a href="http://hhsb.sa.utoronto.ca/recordings.html">Hart House Symphonic Band </a>. No offense Hart House but either the recording is lousy or the band is ... well, anyway, here is <a href="http://hhsb.sa.utoronto.ca/hhsb200401_01_khach_armenian1.mp3">I. Allegro Moderato </a>and <a href="http://hhsb.sa.utoronto.ca/hhsb200401_02_khach_armenian2.mp3">II. Allegro Largemente </a>both in mp3 format. </p>
