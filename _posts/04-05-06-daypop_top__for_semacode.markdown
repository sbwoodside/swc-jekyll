title: daypop top 40 for semacode
---
<p><a href="http://semacode.org">semacode </a>made it to the <a href="http://www.daypop.com/top/">Daypop Top 40 Links </a>today. We're number 18 right now. With an up arrow. And some green bars below. I have no idea what that means. But other people have blue and red bars and some gray ones. I think green is probably good. </p><p>Update: Made it as high as 15. <img src="/weblog/images/2004/daypop.gif" alt="daypop" /></p><p>The blue bars are your existing score. Red bars are a decrease since the last update. Green bars are a gain since the last update. I also caught "semacode" as a wordburst, in position 17. <img src="/weblog/images/2004/wordburst.gif" alt="wordburst" /></p>
