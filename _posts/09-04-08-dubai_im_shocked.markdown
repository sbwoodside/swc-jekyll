So Dubai isn't a wonderland and actually is a vast petrol- and credit-funded nightmare that is on a knife's edge of sinking into the sands, forever gone? I'm shocked! Who could have thought it.
<blockquote>



  If a recession turns into depression, Dr Raouf believes Dubai could run out of 
  water. "At the moment, we have financial reserves that cover bringing 
  so much water to the middle of the desert. But if we had lower revenues â€“ 
  if, say, the world shifts to a source of energy other than oil..." he 
  shakes his head. "We will have a very big problem. Water is the main 
  source of life. It would be a catastrophe. Dubai only has enough water to 
  last us a week. There's almost no storage. We don't know what will happen if 
  our supplies falter. It would be hard to survive."

Here's a thought. Don't build a big city in the middle of a desert. And here's a prediction: Dubai will be gone in 50 years.
