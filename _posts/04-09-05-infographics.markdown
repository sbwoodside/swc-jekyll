An infographic / information graphic is a visual explanation. The point is to visualize some data, information, wisdom, story, etc, into a form that appeals to the visual centers of the brains. A well made infographic, in my opinion, can explain some concepts much better than text. 

The kingpins of infographics in my opinion are <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward E. Tufte </a>and <a href="http://www.nigelholmes.com/home.htm">Nigel Holmes </a>. You can find some kick-ass examples of their graphics on their sites and even more if you dive into google's image search, I'll make it easy for you, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22nigel+holmes%22">holmes </a>, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22edward+tufte%22">tufte1 </a>, and <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22tufte%22">tufte2 </a>. Tufte's specialty is in the visualization of data, and he's written a number of books on the subject that are basically famous and required reading -- I almost never buy books but I just picked up "Envisioning Information". Nigel Holmes is more on the side of explaining concepts which may not be so much data but more like stories, like a lot of news stories, various technical concepts and so on.
