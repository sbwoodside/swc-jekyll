title: Why do people on eHarmony close with "I am pursuing another relationship"?
---
<p>I have a theory about this one. Because they can easily go to Matching and turn it off temporarily. But I think that some people leave it on, because they want the ego boost, even though they're going to shut down the match anyway.</p>
