title: New way to speed read, and Axkit OS X update 
---
<p>This is amazing: <a href="http://trevor.smith.name/EST/indexDown.html">A Speed Reader </a>for some books by Cory Doctorow. It's based on some kind of PARC research. Try it out. Then compare how far you went in the normal book form. I was really surprised. </p><p>Also, I just updated my OS X <a href="/dev/axkit/howto.html">HOWTO </a>for AxKit on Panther. </p>
