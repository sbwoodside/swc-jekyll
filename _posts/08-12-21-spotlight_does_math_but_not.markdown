title: Spotlight does Math (but not conversions)
---
<p>Mac OS X has Spotlight (Cmd-Space) which rocks for not just finding files but launching applications (just start typing the name). I just discovered it also does math, just like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=5*9%2B%28sqrt+10%29%5E3%3D&amp;btnG=Search">google</a>. For example, try typing in <strong>5*9+pow(sqrt(10),3)</strong> . Nifty.</p><p>Alas it doesn't do currency conversion or unit conversions. Maybe in 10.6...?</p>
