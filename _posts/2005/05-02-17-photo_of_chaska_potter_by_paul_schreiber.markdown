<img src="/weblog/images/2005/chaska.jpg" alt="chaska potter" /><br />Paul took this photo of Chaska Potter (of band <a href="http://www.rainingjane.com/home.html">Raining Jane </a>) and I think it's pretty good. Also see <a href="http://paulschreiber.com/photos/rainingjane/chaska-cv-1.jpg">the original full-rez image </a>.
