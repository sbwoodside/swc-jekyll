title: Why Your Code Sucks 
---


It's so true ....... 

The best looking code I ever worked on was the BSD code from Mac OS X. Now that's what I call clean crisp code. OK, so the variable names were a bit cryptic, but they could be decoded once you got the hang of it (they were all very short..). The BSD people I've found out since are known wonks for good clean code. 

These guys at <a href="http://www.artima.com/">Artima </a>are pretty sharp. They're serious code geeks. I think they've talked a lot about refactoring, and if there's one new thing you've learned about coding in the 00's it's what is and how to refactor.
