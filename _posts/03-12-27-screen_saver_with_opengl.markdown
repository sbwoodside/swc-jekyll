title: screen saver with openGL 
---
<p>Do you have Mac OS X? Download my <a href="/fractaltrees/ftxsaver">screen saver </a>. It's powered by OpenGL. It draws about 60 000 primitives per second now on my machine. I suppose to make it any faster now I'd have to look at the math logic and method passing. Also in this version is the option to draw points instead of lines. It's on by default because I think it looks better. </p>
