title: HOWTO develop Symbian apps using Mac OS X 
---


I just posted a <a href="/dev/symbian/howto.html">HOWTO for building Symbian C++ apps on OS X</a>. It's based on the previous HOWTO for OS X and Linux but heavily modified. My goal has always been to do everything on OS X and now I've achieved that goal. So, check out the link to see the howto and get going with Symbian dev on OS X already.
