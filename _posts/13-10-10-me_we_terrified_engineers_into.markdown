<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-apple-employees-say-about-the-companys-internal-corporate-culture-2013-10?op=1">Business Insider</a> quoted me so it must be true!<p>A lazy article to be sure, since it's all taken from Quora.

In any other department, not really.<p>I did actually talk to a journalist a few months ago about Apple's culture, but it seems that nothing came of that.
