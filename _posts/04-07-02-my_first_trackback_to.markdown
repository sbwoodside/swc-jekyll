---
On the continuous quest to make this handrolled blog work better with other people's blogs, I added today the ability to track back to other people's blogs. You can't trackback to me (yet anyway). But I can do it to you :-). So, my last post was my first trackback. <br />There's a lot of stuff to do. Next I need to configure it to ping Technorati as well. <br />How does it work? It's my special brew. ALL XSLT. All the time.
