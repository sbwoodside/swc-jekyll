What a difference a year makes! I started on a big desk upgrade project — before that I was working on a pretty cheap Ikea desk — I started by choosing to get a sit/stand desk. Lots of people at work were getting them and I really buy the idea that standing is good for my health — and my fundamental principle is that moving positions frequently is best for my health. (Don't get frozen in one position!)

I've been living with cheap desks for so long, I wanted to get something high quality. I found a local company that takes Vivo sit/stand frames and puts local cherry tops on them. Very nice! I can't recommend the company because they have gone very upmarket and no longer make the desks, but my desk is lovely, and is finished with [Osmo TopOil High Solid](https://osmo.ca/product/topoil-high-solid/), a natural finish that can be easily reapplied to repair and touch up the surface in the future. It's [available from Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/supplies/finishing/finishes/111802-osmo-clear-topoil?item=27K2770). I might use it for a future project.

I had a pretty good time with cable management at first because it was just my laptop on the desk. Then this winter I got a gaming PC. Not to play games, mind, but to play one game: [Star Citizen](https://starcitizen.tools).

— And Star Citizen is just as good as I thought it would be when I wrote this post [back in 2019](/2019/09/29/star-citizen-video-game.html) and then [again in 2021](/2021/05/27/star-citizen-quantum.html).

Well now I have so many cables, for monitor, mouse, keyboard, dual joysticks, headphones. Suddenly I was scared to raise my desk in case it would pull something off. And my floor was covered in cables! Some kind of solution would be needed.

*Cable "vertebrae" folds up as the desk goes down, keeping cables from pulling*

After watching videos, talking to coworkers, and searching I found a couple of very nice and solid solutions, first, a cable tray to attach under the back of the desk (Monoprice Under Desk Cable Tray) and second a cable spine (VIVO Vertebrae) to reach from the desk to the floor. Parts in hand, I undertook the slightly scary task of drilling holes in the bottom of the desk. But it all worked out and behold, a tidy functional and attractive workspace again.

Other parts I used:

- Monitor arm is Ergotron LX Desk Tall Pole. It's professional grade because I move it around a lot, and if there's one thing I don't like it's things breaking. Tall pole because it's more flexible and I could easily add another monitor later. (I relied on the [Wirecutter review](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-monitor-arms/) for this choice.)
- The white panel on the floor is [Wexstar](https://www.wexstar.com) Infrared Panel Heater 400W White — a far-infrared heater. These heat objects directly, rather than heating the air, making them perfect for under a desk. So they don't dry out the air, and it starts to heat you up as soon as you turn it on. It's a bit like standing in front of a fireplace. I've been able to turn my house heat down a few degrees with this.

*Look how clear it is under the desk!*

- Far-infrared heater is controlled by [Meross Smart Plug Mini 15A](https://www.meross.com/en-gc/smart-plug/homekit-smart-plug/2)
- Various USB and Displayport extension cables from Cable Matters
- USB hub under the desk is [Anker 7-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub](https://www.anker.com/ca/products/a7505?variant=41698712617124)

After using all of this for a month or so, I'm very happy!
