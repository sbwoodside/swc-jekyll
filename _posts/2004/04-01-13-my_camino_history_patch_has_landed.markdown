title: My camino history patch has landed 
---


Mike Pinkerton, lead for Camino, just landed my history patch. This is my first major patch to go into Camino, it's about 1000 lines of code changes or so. It fixes the history view so that you get to see a flat, time-ordered listing with daily folders.
