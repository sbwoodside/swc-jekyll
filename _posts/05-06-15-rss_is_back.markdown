title: RSS is back 
---
<p>RSS went away there for a while. I think that when I changed my back-end of the weblog a few months ago I broke RSS and never fixed it. Then forgot. So now I fixed it. But actually I don't know how, well, actually I did make this one change. Well. </p><p>Anyway, the link should be at the top of the Weblog page and here: <a href="/weblog/rss.xml">RSS feed for Simon Woodside's What's New? weblog </a></p>
