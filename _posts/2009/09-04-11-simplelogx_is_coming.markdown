title: Simplelog-X... is coming...
---


So I just made some major updates to the software running this site, which for now I'm calling "Simplelog-X". And <a href="http://github.com/sbwoodside/simplelog-x/tree/master">the source code for simplelog-x is now on github</a>.

This will probably interest people who are running the original SimpleLog by Garrett Murray <a href="http://simplelog.net/">which he no longer supports</a> (and incidentally it doesn't run on Rails 2.x). Simplelog-X also has quite a few other changes aside from working on (presently) Rails 2.2.2, all of the details are in the README.

I'm not going to annouce this loudly just yet because I still have a whole ton of my own site files in the public directory, and I need to move them to public/system I guess and get them out of the repo but still capistrano-friendly.

I was just making a lot of changes and it struck me how much more I know about Rails now than when I started this journey...
