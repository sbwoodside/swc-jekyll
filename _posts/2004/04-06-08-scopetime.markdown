This <a href="http://www.scopetime.de/english.html">Scopetime </a>is a nifty flash gizmo. It's like a new way of displaying time. I like the presentation as much as the idea. I don't think we really need new ways of displaying time, but on the other hand, I think this idea does actually work, which is pretty unique in this category of "inventions". In other words, I could actually see having a clock that works like this. Anyway, I like the flash.
