title: Some links between Republicans and Vets for Freedom 
---
<p>I was just reading this article on <a href="http://www.patriotproject.com/2006/08/behind_the_fron_2.php">The Vets for Freedom faux grassroots movement </a>. If there's one think that I don't like, it's astroturfing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">See why at wikipedia </a>. Especially political astroturfing, the worst kind. </p><p>The web of connections in the article is pretty confusing so I came up with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographics">information graphic </a>to try to untangle it a bit. </p><a href="/weblog/images/2006/vff/vff_links.pdf"><img src="/weblog/images/2006/vff/vff_links_sm.png" alt="Some links between Republicans and Swift Vets and Vets for Freedom" /></a><p>I have large versions in <a href="/weblog/images/2006/vff/vff_links.pdf">Some links between Republicans and Swift Vets and Vets for Freedom (PDF) </a>suitable for printing at any size, and also bitmaps in <a href="/weblog/images/2006/vff/vff_links.png">PNG </a>, and <a href="/weblog/images/2006/vff/vff_links.jpg">JPEG </a>. </p><p>Keep an eye on this page and / or the blog generally, as I may update the infographic if more information becomes available. </p><p>It's licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">creative commons CC-BY-SA </a>, so if you want the original file (in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle </a>) let me know. </p><p>I cross-posted this on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/8/17/03041/3195">sbwoodside's diary on DailyKos </a>.
