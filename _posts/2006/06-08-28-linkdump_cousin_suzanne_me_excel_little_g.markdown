A bunch of links and things.

[Ahree Lee](http://www.ahreelee.com) created (or is creating?) an amazing short film. Starting in 2001 she started to take a picture of herself, every day, in the same pose. As of 2004, she created a [short film called Me](http://www.atomfilms.com/af/content/me) in which the images are flashed at you at the rate of about one week per second. If you want to download the film, you can use mplayer (like I did...) [with something like this](http://thomer.com/howtos/capture_realstream.html) from your unix shell. (Note that the rtsp URL might change, you can get it from AtomFilms web page / View Source.) (Also note that I had to insert a backslash in front of the exclamation mark, probably inserted by atomfilms to foil script kiddies trying to use this method.) I think you could do some cool analysis of the images over time.

My cousin [Suzanne Thoma](http://statement.fr/) finally has a website. She still sings but mostly she's now a freelance graphic designer. My opinion: website needs some work. I'm not sure that my parents would be able to navigate it.

[How to create little bar charts inside the cells of an Excel spreadsheet](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/08/excel_in_cell_graphing.html) looks useful and pretty easy to do. Generally speaking Excel's graphing sucks, and it looks like the Excel 12 graphs aren't going to get any better. Apple's iWord graphs are somewhat better but not perfect and some important graph types are missing.

Finally, let's hear it for art: [The Grooming of the Woodside Man V1 by Simon Donikian](http://www.donikian.com/TheGroomingV1.jpg) and [The Grooming of the Woodside Man V4](http://www.donikian.com/woodsidemanv4.jpg) .

Enough for now...
