title: server is back

The server is back online. It was never really down, so mailing lists on openict.net kept working, and maybe some other stuff. But AxKit was down because mod_perl was down. Now apparently an update of apache has fixed the problem. I remind you that debian dist-upgrade is NOT something you should be running every week.
