title: RSS moved and some other deltas 
---
<p>I just moved the weblog stuff into /weblog, and so the <a href="/weblog/rss.xml">RSS Feed </a>also moved. I also lost an entry I think. Oh well. Also more stuff validates now. Though not the weblog id's I'm using. That's too bad. But I don't want to change them, because I think they are nice. </p>
