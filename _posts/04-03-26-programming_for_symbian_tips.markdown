title: programming for symbian (tips) 
---


Programming for symbian isn't very sexy. J2ME? That's sexy. But Symbian C++ is NOT sexy. First, at least in theory, you have to use Windows, and windows is NOT sexy. Two, it's C++, and frankly, although C++ may have had some sex-appeal in the mid-90s, it's all gone now. Three, it's poorly documented. What documentation exists is terse and seems to have been generated from header files. It rarely explains <strong>how </strong>to use the API. So for any kind of help understanding how to do it, you have to go to the examples, which are fairly limited. Next you can try NewLC: they have <a href="http://www.newlc.com/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=3">articles </a>and <a href="http://forum.newlc.com/">forums </a>. Next you might want to try searching the Forum Nokia <a href="http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/">discussion area </a>. And finally, be sure not to miss the newsgroups. No, they're not archived anywhere on the web, which is a real pain. But you can access them through your favorite newsreader at <a href="news://publicnews.symbiandevnet.com/">publicnews.symbiandevnet.com </a>. Only the NewLC postings are archived in google, which is a major hassle. There's also a small number of web pages and even some source code floating around on the web with some useful symbian C++ info. So there is some information out there, but you really need to dig to find it.
