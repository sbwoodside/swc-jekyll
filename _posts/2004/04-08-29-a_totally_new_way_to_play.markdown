title: A totally new way to play 
---


This is really cool. It's called <a href="http://www.sony.net/Fun/SonyDesign/2003/BlockJam/future.html">Block Jam and it's a sony design project </a>. There's a video you really should watch but maybe play with the flash demo first. My comments: It's hard to learn, but once you do, it's really neat the way it works. Use lots of starter blocks to get the cool effects.
