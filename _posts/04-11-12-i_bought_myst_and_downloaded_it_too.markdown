title: I bought Myst and downloaded it too 
---
<p>I bought Myst IV, Revelation from amazon.ca but you know, they're a bit slow here and it's not going to arrive until next week. So, having paid I felt no problems about logging into <a href="http://suprnova.org/">SuprNova </a>and snagging the bittorrent for the game. Sure, it's taken 2 days so far and I still won't get it until tomorrow, but at least I'll be able to start playing this weekend :) </p>
