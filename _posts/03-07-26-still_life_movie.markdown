title: Still Life movie 
---


There's an original (very) short film now available from this site. It's called <a href="/movies/">Still Life </a>and you can view it right here (2.6 MB, 48s). It's encoded in MPEG-4, ISMA compatible format with a low data rate but I think the compression looks pretty good. I think you should be able to watch it on any system that has <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">QuickTime 6 </a>installed, Mac, or Windows. Not sure about Linux. If you are unable to view it PLEASE contact me. Enjoy. 

<b>Update: </b>I just tried it and it plays just fine in mplayer OS X, so I think that means it will work in mplayer on Linux, etc. as well. mplayer rocks.
