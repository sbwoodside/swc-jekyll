title: 'New features on the blog: pagination, save to digg, del.icio.us'
---
<p>I just added two new features. First, now you can finally page through the posts 15 at a time (or whatever # it's set to show on the front page), using the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" links at the bottom. Second, you can save a specific post to <a href="http://digg.com">Digg </a>or <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious </a>by just clicking on the appropriate little icon in the meta-data at the top of the post. As if anyone would want to do that. I don't, but I saw it on a bunch of other blogs so I thought I'd do it to. </p><p>I guess in theory you could use digg to discuss the post, if everyone used digg. </p>
