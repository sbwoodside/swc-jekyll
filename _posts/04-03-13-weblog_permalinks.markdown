title: weblog permalinks 
---


I've been playing around with the site a little bit. Apart from the obvious cosmetic changes, I also implemented, finally, real permalinks for my weblog. So when you click that little # after each entry it will take you to an individual page for the entries from that day. Also, my webcounter seems to be approaching 20,000 hits. Doesn't seem like that long ago it was 10,000. <a href="/weblog/2003/06/24">here it is </a>. In another note, google updates its image of my weblog really frequently. For example, if you enter <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=symbian C++ linux">symbian C++ linux </a>I come up with my weblog entry as #4 at the moment. I wonder what will happen when it slides off the front page though?
