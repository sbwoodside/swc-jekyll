title: Huge eucalyptus trees 
---


I was doing a quiz over at <a href="http://www.funtrivia.com/">FunTrivia </a>(which is very cool, and run by <a href="http://www.funtrivia.com/terry/index.cfm?action=who">Terry Ford </a>), and I found out about these amazing trees, the <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/plant_science/field_botany/species/dicots/myrtasp/eucaregn.html">Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus Regnans) </a>. They grow up to 100 m tall. In <a href="http://thegreenman.net.au/mt/archives/000598.html">this picture (left) </a>you can see them relative to a car.
