title: Rove tactics infographic 
---
<p>Here's an image I prepared based on a story about Karl Rover's smear campaign tactics in <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/08/28/moore_rove_swift_boat/index.html">salon.com </a>. My graphic illustrates the story's claims. I haven't personally fact-checked it at all. </p><p>I deliberately chose salon colours and I obviously have higher-resolution versions available. </p><p><a href="/weblog/images/2004/rove.gif"><img src="/weblog/images/2004/rove.gif" alt="karl rove smear campaigns" /></a></p>
