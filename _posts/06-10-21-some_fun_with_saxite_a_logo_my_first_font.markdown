title: Some fun with Saxite, a logo, my first "font" 
---
<p>So <a href="/dev/xml/saxite/">Saxite is the new name </a>for my siteware project. For those of you not paying attention, it's all written in XSLT and XML and it runs on AxKit. </p><p>I decided to make an icon so I came up with this icon, below. </p><p>Like it? I was inspired by a recent issue of <a href="http://www.computerarts.co.uk/about_us/computer_arts_projects">Computer Arts Projects </a>(one of the fantastic UK graphic design magazines that my local Indigo store carries) that was all about fonts, to do some of my own font work. So, I had a visual idea of what I wanted the logo to look like, with the X as a white space in the middle, and then I looked for a font on my system that was very blocky and thick and wound up with Arial Black. "ITE" on Arial Black are very generic, but I really didn't think that the S worked at all for me, and the A didn't fit, and the X I didn't like either (not wide enough). </p><p style="margin: 1em;"><img src="/dev/xml/saxite/images/saxite_logo_sm.png" alt="saxite icon" /></p><p>So I started with the A. I actually did the A from scratch, not even bother to look at the Arial A. It's more like half of an A anyway. Next I got the X in the shape I wanted, and filled in the negative space on the right side with the I. Getting the hole in the A to look right was tricky, right now it's actually a white copy of the shape of the A! </p><p>Oh yeah, and check out the arrow in the A too :-) (it's pointing right). And check out the angle bracket on the right side of the X :-) </p><div class="floating_right"><img src="/weblog/images/2006/saxite-s.png" alt="saxite icon" /></div><p>I spent by far the most time on the "S". I didn't like the original Arial S and wanted to replace it the most since it's by far the most identifiable letter of the ones I used. Also it didn't look blocky and aggressive enough in my opinion. There was quite a bit of variation in the width of stroke which I didn't like, so I drew my own "S" over top of it with a more even stroke (drawn with beziers). I also didn't like the flat ends so I switched over to ends on 45-degree angles. Getting it to balance was interesting ... the bottom end of the S actually extends out beyond the curve above it, while the top end is shorter than the curve below it. Weird. </p><p>I actually tried out another one which was even more streamlined, with the top and bottom strokes ending totally horizontally (like in the Star Wars logo) but that looked too, I don't know, sci-fi? </p><p>Finally I added the hole to the right of the X, before the I. And then I redrew the rest of the letters by hand so that they would all flow together. Now there's no Arial Black left at all. </p><p>Oh yeah, and post-processing in Photoshop to give it that 3d look. </p>
