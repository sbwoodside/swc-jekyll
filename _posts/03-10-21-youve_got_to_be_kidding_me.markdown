<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/840.html">Read this </a>and then ask me whether or not I'm going to insert the rdf:about attribute into my weblog's RSS 1.0 output. I'm not going to repeat the same damn link URL twice in my data just because some RDF weenies think there's a difference between a URI and a whatever even if they are both the same, character-for-character. Since the name "link" just makes more sense, and it's used by more people, I'm using that. </p>
