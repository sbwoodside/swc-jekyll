title: Good advice from Futurama
---
<p>Futurama, possibly one of the best TV shows ever made, say some people. And full of good advice for every day situations too.</p><ul><li><strong>You were doing well until everyone died</strong></li><li><em>Don't do anything that affects anything. Unless it turns out that you were supposed to do it; in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</em></li><li><strong>Bodies are for hookers and fat people.</strong></li><li><em>The Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</em></li><li><strong>If you want a box hurled into the sun, you've got to do it yourself.</strong></li></ul><p>I was going to make up a sort of "All I need to know I learned in Kindergarten" kind of poster, but I need more quotes so I'll just have to re-watch more Futurama. So much good TV &amp; Movies to watch, so little time...</p>
