title: 'Incredible Hulk easter egg: Nick Fury letter'

So there I was, watching the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">Incredible Hulk</a> titles again in slow-motion, because I'm always curious as to what the special effects people write into the various fake news stories and computer graphics. Sometimes it's funny. And I came across this little easter egg which seems to have been missed by fans on the net.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury">Nick Fury</a> and S.H.I.E.L.D. Command are never mentioned in the film. He's part of the comic team Fantastic Four I think (I never really read a lot of comics as a kid, sorry...) which I guess will be having a film some day. Anyway, here's what it says:

<pre><br />Nick Fury<br />Shield Command<br />Code RED<br />New York, NY 060584<br /><br />Details: Classified. Subject is <strong>THREAT LEVEL RED</strong>, surveillance only.<br />The Bruce Banner manhunt is still not over.  This shadowy figure re-<br />nowned as a doctor and professor at the Culver University Science De-<br />partment has once again slipped through the authorites hands and is<br />still on the run.</pre>

That's verbatim by the way. Apparently the letter was never on screen long enough (just a few frames) to warrant a thorough spell check.

How come Marvel puts their logo on their movies, but DC Comics doesn't?
