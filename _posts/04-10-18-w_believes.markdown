In this light, I put together this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_graphics">information graphic </a>of what he believes the world to be like. I don't endorse this world view; it is constructed based on the best available evidence from transcripts of his speeches and media reports. I do not believe that any of this material is controversial.
