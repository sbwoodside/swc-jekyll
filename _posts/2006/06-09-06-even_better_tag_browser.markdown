title: Even better tag browser! 
---


Well now I've got an <a href="/weblog/tags">even better tag browser </a>. In fact I think it's the coolest tag browser ever. It's better than the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/">flickr tag browser </a>and the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/">technorati tag browser </a>and amazingly, even then <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">del.icio.us tag browser </a>. And what is delicious for if not tag browsing. Well. 

Anyway, I used a sort of crazy CSS-float-left thing to make the big and small boxes all go inline together. It would have made more sense to use inline-block but it's not supported in Mozilla yet (weird). 

Also, you will note that this new browser really brings out the awesomeness of my <a href="/weblog/2006/06/24">two-level tagging scheme </a>because now for the first time you can see how the levels work. And I'm discovering that maybe I have some duplication oops, and I'm also completely inconsistent in how I capitalize. Hmm. I might edit my tags (I suppose that's bad for google though, oh well). 

Anyway, the big names in the filled-in boxes are the "categories" and the names in the small white boxes are the "tags"... some day I might allow to view just the tags but I'm not quite sure what that would mean. 

Note to self: I should add some category browser on the left side there.
