<p>I just spent a whole bunch of time sorting my tags. Because I have the <a href="/weblog/tags/">best tag browser ever </a>and so I'm having some fun going through and tagging my content and making my tags better now. For example, I had no rhyme or reason for uppercase, some were mixed-case, some were uppercase, some were lowercase. I decided to make them all lowercase. </p><p>So, a bunch of tags were renamed which will break links but too bad, backwards-compatibility is for losers. Also, I don't think people have really linked to my tags yet. But they will.... </p><p>Anyway, I also added some new tags and went back and tagged a bunch more old posts too. Have a look at <a href="/weblog/tag/original/prediction">original/prediction </a>(my "original work" making predictions about the future). Or how about <a href="/weblog/tag/computer/wi-fi">computer/wi-fi </a>(lots of developing world stuff in there...). Or how about just <a href="/weblog/tag/meta">meta </a>(navel gazing fun). Yum. </p>
