This is their idea of a good new logo.

After the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/will_waterloo_logo_survive.php">previous new logo got crapped on because it totally sucked</a>.

The new new one? Looks like a beer glass being poured out.

While that may be appropriate reflection of the student body, it's not my idea of a good image for the school. Please UW, fire your graphic designers and hire new ones who can draw. Maybe go to Toronto to find some good ones? Or New York?

Prediction: this is going to go on for a long time...
