title: BlackBerry storm clicks, I like it.
---
<p>One of my biggest dislikes with touch-screen devices is the total lack of tactile feedback. There are other things I don't like about them, but that's a biggy. So when I played around with the BB Storm's clickable screen. I liked it. I only played with the browser, which was competent, actually quite good, and very close to as good as the iPhone. So I can't provide an overall review of the Storm. But the clicking, that's good.</p>
