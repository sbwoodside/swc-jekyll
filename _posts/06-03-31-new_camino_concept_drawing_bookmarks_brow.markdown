title: 'New camino concept drawing: Bookmarks browser with preview pane'
---
<div class="floating_right"><a href="/weblog/images/2006/bookmarks_with_preview.graffle.pdf"><img src="/weblog/images/2006/bookmarks_with_preview_sm.png" /></a></div><p>I'm always super pissed off with the Camino bookmarks browser because I can't organize my bookmarks and view the pages at the same time. (Safari is no better.) In fact I was never happy about the transition from drawer to bookmarks panel but hey, what can you do. The drawer wasn't popular. </p><p>Anyway, here's a new idea which I think would make organizing my bookmarks <strong>a lot easier </strong>. I can never remember what all my bookmarks are for, and having a little preview would make it a lot easier to sort them out. So, with this floating around in my head somewhere I was pretty impressed with the "now playing" box in iTunes where you can see a live preview of video podcasts that you've downloaded. </p><p>So, <a href="/weblog/images/2006/bookmarks_with_preview.graffle.pdf">here is a concept drawing </a>of what Camino bookmarks browser would look like if it had a preview pane. Thoughts? Email me! <a href="mailto:sbwoodside@yahoo.com">sbwoodside@yahoo.com </a>(my public/spammable email address). </p>
