title: the ultimate cut out book
---
<p>You have probably seen the book with a space cut out to hide a knife, a gun, another book... but what about a house?</p><p>(actually, hiding a book inside a book... that's a cool idea...)</p><p>Anyway, that's <a href="http://www.olafureliasson.net/">Olafur Eliasson</a> has done. He cut a house into a book. There's no text. Just the house. And it's in negative space. Here's what it looks like:</p><p><img alt="Your House" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2163/2352081142_4b25a201cc_d.jpg" /></p><p>Wild. I found this in <a href="http://www.grafikmagazine.co.uk/">grafik magazine</a>. No website, but a real paper work of art.</p><p>Eliasson is just too cool. Have a look at what he does with <a href="http://kk.org/kk/2007/10/olafur-eliassons-nerdy-art.php">white lego bricks</a>... and just generally <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Olafur+Eliasson">feast your eyes on his works</a>.</p>
