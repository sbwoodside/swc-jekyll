title: Amazing video footage! 
---


Well, ok, maybe it's not amazing. But it exists. I wish I could do all this through flickr but I can't because they suck and don't handle 3gp video. Not that I really blame them since it's still really blurry and stuff, but hey, it moves and you can hear stuff. Anyway I just implemented a way to throw these videos into my blog and pages much more easily (using the power of XSLT) so here are two that I took this last Sunday.

Steve and I went for a little walk and we saw this kick ass monarch. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sbwoodside/28537241/">here's a photo of it getting away </a>. And here is a video I made when I saw it with my trusty Nokia 6630. It tried to get away, but then it came back.

Later on at the university we saw a hawk or something. Probably a red-tailed hawk since they're pretty common around here. It was too far away to get a good photo but I have this video of Steve climbing illegally anyway.
