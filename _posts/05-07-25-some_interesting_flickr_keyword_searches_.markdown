title: Some interesting flickr keyword searches (or tags whatever) 
---
<p>Just though of looking at some interesting words in flickr. I just saw some persons blog where they were talking about the power of words. Well, I'm a person with a fairly large vocabulary. Not that I deliberately use pedantic words (like in monty python: </p><blockquote><pre>[customer] I was just sitting the local library reading ... by Hugh Walpole when I came over all peckish [shopkeeper] Peckish sir? [c] esurient [s] eh? [c] eeoooungrylike [s] ahhh... hungry [c] precisely. And so I curtailed my walpoling activities and sallied forth to infiltrate your place of purvayance in order to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles. [s] come again sir? [c] [very clearly] I want to buy some cheese. </pre></blockquote><p>So anyway... I decided to search for "symbol" since I'm so interested in the visual representation of information. </p><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/symbol">All flickr images tagged with "symbol" </a></p><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/logo">"logo" might be worth looking at in more detail </a></p><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/symbology">"symbology" anyone? (people love to complexify words...) </a></p><p>Hmm... not as satisfying a search as I thought it might be. </p>
